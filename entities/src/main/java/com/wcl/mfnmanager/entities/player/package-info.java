 * Contains two core entity objects, @see Player and @see Potential.
 *
 * @link Player is the model of a Player within the game.  It contains basic core data along with decomposed
 * skill classes avoiding an overly large single class.
 *
 * @link Potential contains two attributes, current and future.  Each individual skill attribute is made up
 * of a @link Potential object.
